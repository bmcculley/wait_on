The wait_on command allows shell scripts to access the facilities provided
by kqueue(3) on FreeBSD.

The wait_on command waits for something to happen to the files or
directories given as arguments and then exits.  It is anticipated that the
wait_on command will allow, for example, a script to sleep until files have
been added to a directory or data is appended to a file.

No polling is required.
